# 🧰 C++ Windows Community Toolkit

The C++ Windows Community Toolkit is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer patterns when building experiences for Windows 10 and Windows 11. It contains components and helpers for WinUI 3/WinAppSDK applications developed using C++/WinRT. It is a port of the [Windows Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit)

## 📃 Documentation

All documentation for the original toolkit is hosted on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/). All API documentation can be found at the [.NET API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/?view=win-comm-toolkit-dotnet-stable).
